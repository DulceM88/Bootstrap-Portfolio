					<p id="adLorem">Michael! Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. No… but I'd like to be asked! Whoa, this guy's straight? I've opened a door here that I regret. No… but I'd like to be asked!

					That's why you always leave a note! Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Well, what do you expect, mother? Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Guy's a pro.

					I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Really? Did nothing cancel? I hear the jury's still out on science. I've opened a door here that I regret.

					That's why you always leave a note! I'm afraid I just blue myself. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Well, what do you expect, mother?

					I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. That's why you always leave a note! No… but I'd like to be asked! I hear the jury's still out on science.

					There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I've opened a door here that I regret. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. Guy's a pro. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.
